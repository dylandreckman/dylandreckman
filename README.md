- 👋 Hi, I’m @dylandreckman. I am a former cook turned software engineer. I still have a great love for cooking and creating new dishes to enjoy, but I feel that software engineering is a great career path that can lead me to great places!
- 👀 I’m interested in cooking, coding, video games, and relaxing with friends.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning web development.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on nothing at the moment.
- 📫 How to reach me (not yet).
